##Mind-Pops

A Rails and Angular app built for my WDI (Web Development Immersive) final project at General assembly.

Mind pops is an app that allows users to store their most random thoughts, share them with others and enhance their creativity.


For my final project, I created an app using a Rails backend and an AngularJS front end where users could register, login and create a log of their random thoughts. Scientists report that if you dwell on your random thoughts it can enhance your creativity. I wanted to create an app where users can reap those benefits and also share their thoughts and view those of others.

The project went well as I was able to produce what I had envisioned from start. I had wanted to produce a simple, clean app with a slightly comic look and I think this aesthetic was successfully achieved.

**Going forward**

If I were to do this project again I would focus more on the responsiveness of the app.
